# Agent Guidelines

- Use the `gpt-5.1-codex-max` model for reasoning and code generation when applicable.
- Keep the project configured for Java 17 with Gradle (Groovy DSL).
- Favor clear, readable, and compact implementations that follow clean code principles.
- Use Java 17 for source and target compatibility across the project.
